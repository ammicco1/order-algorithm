HERE'S THE MAIN SORT ALGORITHM WHICH ARE:
 - INSERTIONSORT 
 - MERGESORT
 - HEAPSORT
 - QUICKSORT

ALL OF THEESE ARE IMPLEMENTED IN C. 

NOW LET'S TAKE A LOOK TO THE COMPLEXITY:
 - INSERTIONSORT IN THE WORST CASE HAS A COMPLEXITY OF O(n^2).
 - MERGESORT IN THE WORST CASE HAS A COMPLEXITY OF O(n logn).
 - HEAPSORT IN THE WORST CASE HAS A COMPLEXITY OF O(n logn).
 - QUICKSORT IN THE WORST CASE HAS A COMPLEXITY OF O(n^2).

ARGUMENTS OF THE ALGORITHMS FUNCTION:
 - INSETIONSORT FUNCTION TAKES:
    - THE ARRAY
    - THE LENGTH OF THE ARRAY 
    AS ARGUMENTS.
 - MERGESORT FUNCTION TAKES:
    - THE ARRAY 
    - THE LOWEST INDEX OF THE ARRAY (QUITE ALWAYS 0)
    - THE HIGEST INDEX OF THE ARRAY (LENGTH - 1)
     AS ARGUMENTS.
 - HEAPSORT FUNCTION TAKES:
    - THE ARRAY
    - THE LENGTH OF THE ARRAY 
    AS ARGUMENTS.
 - QUICKSORT FUNCTION TAKES:
    - THE ARRAY 
    - THE LOWEST INDEX OF THE ARRAY (QUITE ALWAYS 0)
    - THE HIGEST INDEX OF THE ARRAY (LENGTH - 1)
     AS ARGUMENTS.
